I am a student of Computer Science & Engineering, Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh. My father is a Service Holder whose salary is very meager. He maintains our family in a very simple way. My younger sister is also studying at 12th Standard. So expenditure for the education purpose of me and my sister is not that less in the context of our educational system. My mother is a housewife and there is no other person in my family to support us financially. I have completed my graduation about 75% with lots of difficulties and a lack of special facilities throughout my path. It is almost impossible to take courses for my career development or such special facilities at the expense of my father. It is already very much tough for my father to maintain my family's basic needs. If I want to take this course for making my career smoother, I must need financial aid from you. So I would fervently request you to take my case with serious concern and oblige thereby.

I am a student of Computer Science & Engineering, Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh. I have experience in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern in MyMedicalHUB and associated with Professor Dr. Al Mehedi Hasan, for learning Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. I have some sort of knowledge about Statistics, Probability, Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised and Reinforcement Learning, Decision Tree, K-means Clustering, K-nearest Neighbors, Data Warehousing, Naive Bayes, and so on. I feel passionate about this field and want to take myself in a better position in it. Actually, I think this field can be very much suitable as my career goal. I also very much eager to do some research and thesis works with AI, ML, and DL under my mentor's supervision. So it will be very nice of you if I am provided with this course.
